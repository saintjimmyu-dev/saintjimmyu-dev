## 👨‍💻 About Me

My main experience has focused on the development, integration, and optimization of data solutions, working with technologies such as Oracle, SQL Server, and cloud environments, across projects in different sectors.

I have mainly worked on:
Optimization of ETL processes and complex queries (SQL, T-SQL, PL/SQL)
System and data integration through REST APIs (OIC, XML, JSON)
Development of analytical solutions in Databricks (PySpark, Delta)

I am currently focused on the development of applied AI solutions, with an emphasis on AI Agents and multi-agent systems, integrating language models with data, business workflows, and enterprise systems. As part of these solutions, I work with RAG techniques and Vector Databases to enable more accurate reasoning and responses.

My main areas of focus include:
🔹 LLMs & Agentic AI: LangChain, LangGraph, MCP, RAG
🔹 Automation and Integration: APIs, workflow orchestration, tools-based agents
🔹 Data + AI: Advanced SQL, Databricks, Python applied to AI
🔹 Cloud Generative AI: AWS, Amazon Bedrock, and agent architectures in production

This approach allows me to build practical, scalable AI solutions aligned with real business needs, combining my data expertise with modern AI capabilities.
